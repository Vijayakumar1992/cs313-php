I love this facinating palace and I was fortunate to visit this remarkable beauty. The Taj Mahal is a 
white tomb built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz 
Mahal. The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Widely thought as one of the most beautiful
buildings in the world, it is one of India's biggest tourist attractions.
