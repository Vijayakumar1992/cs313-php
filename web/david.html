    <p>I love this facinating palace and I was fortunate to visit this remarkable beauty. The Taj Mahal is a <br>
        white tomb built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz <br>
        Mahal. The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Widely thought as one of the most beautiful<br>
        buildings in the world, it is one of India's biggest tourist attractions. </p>
